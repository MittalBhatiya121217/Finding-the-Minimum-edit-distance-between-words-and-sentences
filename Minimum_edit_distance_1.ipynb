        "In natural language processing (NLP), alignment refers to the process of finding correspondences between elements of text. This can be useful in a variety of applications, including machine translation and information retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Backtrace is a common algorithm used for computing alignments between sequences of text. The basic idea behind backtrace is to work backwards from the end of the sequences, identifying the best alignment between each pair of characters or words.\n",

        "Here's a step-by-step overview of how backtrace works for computing alignment in NLP:\n",

        "Input: Given two sequences of text to be aligned, sequence A and sequence B.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initialization: Create a matrix with dimensions (length of A + 1) x (length of B + 1). Each cell in the matrix will represent the cost of aligning a character or word from sequence A with a character or word from sequence B. The first row and first column are initialized with 0s.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fill the matrix: For each cell in the matrix (excluding the first row and first column), calculate the cost of aligning the corresponding characters or words from sequence A and sequence B. The cost can be based on various factors, such as the similarity of the characters or words, or the distance between them in a semantic space. Once the cost is calculated, set the value of the cell to the cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Backtrace: Starting from the bottom-right corner of the matrix, find the optimal path to the top-left corner. This can be done by following the path with the lowest cost, and making diagonal, vertical, or horizontal moves. As you traverse the path, record the alignments between the characters or words in sequence A and sequence B.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: The final output of the backtrace algorithm is the optimal alignment between the two sequences, as well as the cost of the alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Backtrace is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to efficiently compute alignments between sequences of any length. However, the cost function used in step 3 can greatly affect the quality of the alignment, so choosing an appropriate cost function is important for achieving good results."

        "## Flavors of Sequence Alignment: Global vs. Local Alignment\n",
        "\n",
        "Sequence alignment comes in several different flavors or varieties:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Global sequence alignment** assumes two sequences are homologous (or share a common evolutionary ancestor) across their whole length. It tries to line up the whole thing, from tail to snout. This might be a reasonable assumption for two genes in the same gene family, for instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Local sequence alignment** assumes that there are regions of homology within a bigger sequence, but also regions that do not share common ancestry. This might be a reasonable assumption if checking how many genes two species share. If the species aren't extremely closely related, we would expect that they would share certain genes, but also that there should be large portions of the genome that do not share detectable evolutionary ancestry between the two species (due to large insertions, deletions, inversions or rearrangements).\n",
        "\n",
        "Alignment methods can also be **pairwise** methods, in which two sequences are aligned or **multiple sequence alignments** in which many sequences are aligned together (e.g. all the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase genes in mammals).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter we will focus first on global alignment. However, once you understand global alignment in detail, the algorithm for local alignment is similar enough that you can understand that as well, with just a little extra effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "In **pairwise global sequence alignment** we begin with two sequences. These can be DNA, RNA or amino acid sequences. For simplicity, let's focus at first on pairwise global alignment of DNA sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll assume that the full length of our two sequences are homologous, but may contain *insertions* or *deletions* of nucleotides that have caused the homologous positions not to line up with each other. Therefore, our goal is to 'align' or line up these homologous positions in the sequences by adding '-' characters to certain places in each sequence.  These '-' characters will represent places where the two nucleotide sequences become offset from one another (and therefore stop lining up) due to either an extra nucleotide inserted into one, or a nucleotide deleted from the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example. Let's start with two unaligned DNA sequences: `AAAATATTGG` and `TCCTATGG`. If we try to compare sequence identity between these sequences without alignment, we won't see a high level of sequence similarity:\n",
        "\n",
        "`AAAATATTGG` <br>\n",
        "`TCCTATGG`\n",
        "\n",
        "Indeed, if you compare the nulceotides that line up, you'll see that *none* of them match. If we wanted to formalize this, we could calculate the Hamming Distance between the two sequences (just 1 - the fraction of matching items), and we would find a distance of 1.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yet it is probably clear that the sequences have many similarities. If we upload these sequences to a pairwise global alignment web tool (like the EMBOSS one at [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/services/web/toolresult.ebi?jobId=emboss_needle-I20201212-184827-0832-96343451-p1m)), we might get a result that looks something like this:\n",

        "EMBOSS_001         1 ------TCCTATGG      8`\n",
        "\n",
        "From a pairswise alignment alone, we can't distinguish whether '-' characters represent insertion in the sequence without the '-' or deletion in the sequence with the '-'. For this reason '-' characters are called *gaps* or *indels* (short for *in*sertion **or** *del*etion)."

For most algorithms, that means it is extremely important that we work a couple examples by hand before we try to code them. This might seem like extra work, but in fact saves **a ton** of time in the long run.\n",

        "> **Coding tip for complex code:** If you take the time to really experiment with each python data structure and understand how it works, and take the time to do an algorithm by hand so you understand how it works, and if you build your code step by step in small pieces that you can check as you go, then even very complex algorithms become much easier to put together.\n",

        "First, we need to settle on a scoring scheme that is based on how much we want to penalize insertion of indels ('-') vs. substitions (e.g. A --> G). We can choose to score all substitutions equally, or assign a different score to some substitutions (e.g. to reflect that biologically transitions are much more common than transversions). Generally, the more common insertions or deletions are biologically, the lower the gap penalty should be. Similarly, the more common substitutions are, the lower the substitution penalty should be. For simplicity in this example, we will use a very simple scoring scheme:\n",

        "\n",
        "**Meaning of diagonal moves.** If we start in the upper left corner and proceed digonally down the table, that represents an alignment in which we only use *substitutions* (mutations that change one nucleotide into another) to explain the differences between the two sequences.\n",

        "This is a pretty bad alignment (only 2 matches and 5 mismatches). We'll improve on it in a moment, but can you see how the row/column labels you would encounter if you go from top left to bottom right in the table correspond to this alignment? If not, it may be worth trying it by hand step-by-step: the first cell you'd enter in the top left would have a G in both the row and the column. That represents the match between the G's in the top and bottom sequence in the alignment above. The next step would have a C in the column but an A in the row. That would represent the mismatch between C and A in the second position of the alignment. Mistmatches like this indicate that during evolution either the ancestor was a C and one sequence had a C --> A substitution in the bottom sequence, or the ancestor was an A and there was an A--> C substitution in the top sequence.\n",

        "Let's say after starting in the upper-left of the table we took one step to the right, *and then* proceeded as before to travel diagonally down the table. What would that mean for our alignment? If you try this with your finger on the table above, you'll see that the first cell you reach has column label G and now row label. This would indicate that the first G in our first sequence is paired with nothing ('-') in our second sequence. Biologically, this would indicate that the ancestral sequence either had a G and it was lost in the bottom sequence (a deletion) or that the G was added by mutation into the top sequence (an insertion). Now move your finger down and to the right. The next cell you encounter is no longer a pairing of G with G (as before) but now a pairing of the first G in the bottom sequence with the C in position 2 of the top sequence. Effectively, all our other pairings will be 'offset' by 1 due to the insertion in the left sequence.  This will change which positions look like matches vs. mismatches.

Basically this means setting up code that lets us visit each cell in the array one by one - like running our finger along a table to read each row one by one from top to bottom.\n",
        "\n",
        "To visit a cell in the table, we need it's *index*, which is the row and column number for that cell. So to visit all the cells, our main challenge is to generate each row and column number one by one. To do this we will set up an outer `for` loop that iterates over each row one by one, setting each row number to a variable (here I call this variable `row_index`, but `i` is most commonly used in real code). Within each loop over the row numbers, an inner `for` loop iterates over each column number one by one and sets its value to a variable (here I use `col_index`, but `j` is most typically used in real code). Inside both loops, we will have a value for the current row and column number. We can use these to index into the scoring array using array indexing (`scoring_array[row_index,column_index]`).\n",

        "**Smith-waterman algorithm:**\n",
        "The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that performs local sequence alignment, which means that it finds the best match between  two sequence within a smaller region of the sequences. It is widely used in bioinformatics for tasks such as identifying similarities between protein or DNA sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algortithm assign a score to each alignment between two sequences. The score is calucate based on score matrix, which assign a value to each possible rest of pair based on their similarity or difference, now the algorithm create matrix for all possible alignments, where each rows and columns intersaction(cell) of the matrix represent the score for the best alignment ending at this position for sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To calculate the score for matrix of each cell:**\n",
        "We are calculating all the gaps and matched and mismatched charcaters using below conditions:\n",
        "A gap penalty while delete operation occured.\n",
        "A gap penalty while insert operation occured.\n",
        "A matched charcater bonus for leftover character.\n",
        "A mismatched penalty for leftover characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then algorithm select the highest scoring matrix cell for the starting point for the best alignment, and trace back through the whole matrix to find the path that create the highest score.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important part of the algorithm is that it allows local alignment, which means that it allows to find alignments within the matrix alignment of the sequences which is not similar globally. This happend because algorithm uses a dynamic programming that allows it to accept the specific features for the sequences being aligned.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the smith-waterman algorithm is a most popular for identifying similarity between two sequences, and it use with assign score for alignments between two sequences and also find the best possible alignment through the dynamic programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For Instance :**\n",
        "Now focusing on the example above here we are using smith-waterman algorithm for achieving our goal to find the optimal solution for highest score alignment or best highest alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**def smith_waterman(seq1, seq2, matchingscore=2, mismatchedscore=-1, gapspenalty=-1)::**\n",
        "this is the main function which is used for doing operations using smith-waterman algorithm where 5 parameters is passed as follows, seq1 as a sequence 1, seq2 as a sequence 2, matchingscore=2 is if matched then its 2, mismatchedscore=-1 if its not matched then its -1 penalty and if its gaps then gapspenalty=-1.\n",
        "after that we create for loop for score matrix where for loop will be executed upto the ranges of the sequences with max_i,max_j.\n",
        "After that we are performing some operations of matched, mismatched and gapspenalty for scoring matrix using for loop with two sequences.at the last we are calculating the max score for max_i,max_j after matched,insert and delete operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now based on the score we are finding the maximum score and now we are finding the most highest score based on alignment and we are using traceback for that for checking the optimal alignment of highest score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we are defining the two sequences additionally, we are checking the alignment score using smith-waterman algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the top of that, now we are printing the alignment as well as score the matrix value. here the two sequences are:\n",
